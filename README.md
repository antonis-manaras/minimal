# Minimal
------------

Minimal is a template for [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/). It is built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and it is meant to be a minimal, simple, non distractive blog and personal page.

**Note:** This is still WIP!

At the moment it is not very customizable, as some parts (e.g. picture) are hardcoded. I am working on improving these issues.

## Work to be done

- [ ] Clean code, fix identation
- [ ] Make picture dynamic
- [ ] Improve menu
- [ ] Rewrite parts of html code using <article> tags to improve article manipulation
- [ ] Add social buttons in articles
- [ ] Write analytics.html, search.html (missing content: not used in this phase)
